Presidential election- The Constitution specifies how the president and vice
president are selected. Each state elects, by popular vote, a group of electors equal
in number to its total of members of Congress. The 23rd Amendment, adopted
in 1961, grants the District of Columbia three presidential electors, a number
equal to that of the least populous state.

Subsequent to the election, the electors meet in their respective states to vote for
president and vice president. Usually, each elector votes for the candidate receiving
the most popular votes in his or her state.

A majority vote of all electors is necessary to elect the president and vice president.

If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives, with each state
having one vote, is empowered to elect the president and vice president, again,
with a majority of votes required.

The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1951, 
limits presidential tenure to two elective terms of 4 years each
or to one elective term for any person who, upon succession to the presidency,
has held the office or acted as President for more than 2 years.
