# Assessing the impact of socio-economic factors on Presidential election voting in the USA in 2016

# Data available
# You are provided a data set on Presidential election results for each US county in 2016
# PresElect2016R.csv and socio-economic data from the US Census Bureau (until 2014), in
# the file UScounty-facts.csv. An additional file, UScounty-dictionary.csv, is provided,
# which lists the detailed descriptions of variables available in the county facts file. For the
# purposes of this analysis, you may assume that there was an election involving only two
# parties in each county: Republican and Democratic. A brief description of the variables in
# the files are listed below:

# File 1: PresElect2016R.csv
# Column 1: state
# Column 2: state.po (2-letter state abbreviation)
# Column 3: county (county name)
# Column 4: FIPS (unique ID for county from US Census records)
# Column 5: candidatevotesR (number of votes cast for Republican presidential candidate)
# Column 6: totalvotes (total number of votes cast in the county)
# Column 7: fracvotesR (fraction of total votes received by the Republican Presidential candidate)
# Column 8: partywonR (binary variable that takes the value 1 if the Republican candidate 
#           won in that county; is otherwise zero)

# File 2: UScounty-facts.csv
# The columns of this file correspond to measurements on several variables for each county,
# described in UScounty-dictionary.csv. Variables 1-18 correspond to demographic variables
# relating to the population and racial composition of counties. Variables 19 and 20 correspond
# to educational attainment; variable 21 to the number of war veterans in the county; variables
# 22-28 relate to housing; variables 29-42 to income and employment; variables 43-47 to sales;
# and variables 48-50 to building permits, land area and population per square mile, respectively.

# Question(s) of interest
# The main questions of interest are twofold: first, are there any discernible associations between
# various socio-economic and other factors and the propensity of the county population to vote
# for a particular party? Second, can the relationship between various factors and primary
# election results by county be consolidated into a model that can forecast the actual 2016
# presidential election results, by state? In particular, you may want to consider:
# - Are there specific socio-economic or demographic factors that are associated with an
#   increased or decreased preference for a political party, in a county?
# - Is there an association between specific socio-economic or demographic factors and the
#   fraction of people voting for a Republican Presidential candidate in a county?
# - Are there state-wide factors that are associated with a preference for one political party
#   over another?
# - How well can your model associating socioeconomic factors with 2016 election results
#   be used to predict the final state-wide outcome of the presidential elections in 2016?
# (For this question you might want to locate a data set listing the winning party in each
# state- this is available on numerous internet news sites, such as CNN.com or NPR.org;
# alternatively, you can consolidate data from within your existing data set.)

###########

#  The problem, to start with, is manipulating data sets with large numbers of variables 
# and merging records across diferent data sets (electoral outcomes and socio-economic variables). 
# It will be useful to keep in mind that certain counties listed in one file may or 
# may not appear in the other; also there may be counties in which either electoral or census 
# data may have to be discarded for some reason, for example, missingness in some variables. 
# Groups of demographic/economic variables may be related by nature and must be handled carefully
# (e.g. you may not be able to use them simultaneously in a regression-type model). 
# Some variables measured are on widely diferent scales of magnitude from others and care must be 
# taken to ensure that any analysis undertaken is not afected by this. 
# Preliminary exploratory analyses would be invaluable in determining which variables to look at 
# more closely for the later statistical analysis. 
# Note that you might want to use either the data on winning party,
# or proportion of votes won, as a response - they may not give identical results. 

# Use of the maps package might be useful for visualisation of the distribution of variables 
# across counties/states. For the advanced chapter, one option would be to source data from the 
# earlier election (see, for example, US Presidential election data, 2012, from 
# https://electionlab.mit.edu/data) and corresponding census data (http://www.census.gov) 
# and determine whether socio-economic changes over the intervening period can 
# explain the diferences in election results between the two years.
