# so two votes for every state because each has two senators
# and 1 vote for each congressperson
# so the smallest states have at minimum 3 electoral college votes
# this allocation gives disproportionate weight to smaller rural states
# with low populations
# that also, more often then note, are VERY white demographically
# white folk are on average older then total population and markedly wealthier than other groups. 
# both attributes also make them far more reliable voters

# Part II. Spatio-temporal patterns in collinearity
# Part III. Methods for dealing with collinearity 
## Detect it: diagnostics 
## Removing collinearity prior to analysis 
>> Before analysis
- Clustering, PCA, K-means clustering
  - Central variable from cluster (biased)
  - Best regressor -> increase of Type 1 errors
- Cluster-independent methods
  - Select variables correlated |r| < 0.7
  - Sequential regression
>> Modelling with latent variables
- PCR (principal components regression)
- DR (Dimension reduction)
