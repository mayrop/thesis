abstract = {Analyzing data sets of billions of records has now become a regular task in many companies and institutions. In the statistical analysis of those massive data sets, sampling generally plays a very important role. In this work, we describe a scalable simple random sampling algorithm, named ScaSRS, which uses probabilistic thresholds to decide on the fly whether to accept, reject, or wait-list an item independently of others. We prove, with high probability, it succeeds and needs only O(âˆš k) storage, where k is the sample size. ScaSRS extends naturally to a scalable stratified sampling algorithm, which is favorable for heterogeneous data sets. The proposed algorithms , when implemented in MapReduce, can effectively reduce the size of intermediate output and greatly improve load balancing. Empirical evaluation on large-scale data sets clearly demonstrates their superiority.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * * , 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Logistic regression does not require grouping of observations to obtain valid estimates of effects and of outcome probabilities, and it has been shown in the binary case to provide more accurate probability estimates than linear discriminant analysis when the assumptions of the latter (i.e., multivariate normality of predictor variables with common covariance matrix) are violated. Even when multivariate normality holds, logistic regression has been shown to yield probability estimates virtually as accurate as those obtained using discriminant analysis. The assumptions of the logistic regression model are for the most part straightforward and easy to verify. A general purpose SAS macro language program to verify the assumptions of the binary or ordinal model graphically will be discussed. Examples demonstrating the advantages of logistic regression for binary and ordinal dependent variables over other methods will also be presented. Background},

abstract = {The assessment of the performance of learners by means of benchmark experiments is an established exercise. In practice, benchmark studies are a tool to compare the performance of several competing algorithms for a certain learning problem. Cross-validation or resampling techniques are commonly used to derive point estimates of the performances which are compared to identify algorithms with good properties. For several benchmarking problems, test procedures taking the variability of those point estimates into account have been suggested. Most of the recently proposed inference procedures are based on special variance estimators for the cross-validated performance. We introduce a theoretical framework for inference problems in benchmark experiments and show that standard statistical test procedures can be used to test for differences in the performances. The theory is based on well defined distributions of performance measures which can be compared with established tests. To demonstrate the usefulness in practice, the theoretical results are applied to regression and classification benchmark studies based on artificial and real world data.},

In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case.

abstract = {Classification of patient samples is an important aspect of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully applied to microarray cancer diagnosis problems. However, one weakness of the SVM is that given a tumor sample, it only predicts a cancer class label but does not provide any estimate of the underlying probability. We propose penalized logistic regression (PLR) as an alternative to the SVM for the microarray cancer diagnosis problem. We show that when using the same set of genes, PLR and the SVM perform similarly in cancer classification, but PLR has the advantage of additionally providing an estimate of the underlying probability. Often a primary goal in microarray cancer diagnosis is to identify the genes responsible for the classification, rather than class prediction. We consider two gene selection methods in this paper, univariate ranking (UR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Empirical results indicate that PLR combined with RFE tends to select fewer genes than other methods and also performs well in both cross-validation and test samples. A fast algorithm for solving PLR is also described.},

abstract = {This set of notes presents the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. SVMs are among the best (and many believe are indeed the best) "off-the-shelf" supervised learning algorithms. To tell the SVM story, we'll need to first talk about margins and the idea of separating data with a large "gap." Next, we'll talk about the optimal margin classifier, which will lead us into a digression on Lagrange duality. We'll also see kernels, which give a way to apply SVMs efficiently in very high dimensional (such as infinite-dimensional) feature spaces, and finally, we'll close off the story with the SMO algorithm, which gives an efficient implementation of SVMs. 1 Margins: Intuition We'll start our story on SVMs by talking about margins. This section will give the intuitions about margins and about the "confidence" of our predictions ; these ideas will be made formal in Section 3. Consider logistic regression, where the probability p(y = 1|x; $\theta$) is mod-eled by h $\theta$ (x) = g($\theta$ T x). We would then predict "1" on an input x if and only if h $\theta$ (x) â‰¥ 0.5, or equivalently, if and only if $\theta$ T x â‰¥ 0. Consider a positive training example (y = 1). The larger $\theta$ T x is, the larger also is h $\theta$ (x) = p(y = 1|x; w, b), and thus also the higher our degree of "confidence" that the label is 1. Thus, informally we can think of our prediction as being a very confident one that y = 1 if $\theta$ T x â‰« 0. Similarly, we think of logistic regression as making a very confident prediction of y = 0, if $\theta$ T x â‰ª 0. Given a training set, again informally it seems that we'd have found a good fit to the training data if we can find $\theta$ so that $\theta$ T x (i) â‰« 0 whenever y (i) = 1, and 1},

We illustrate the use of this model by attempting to resolve a controversy over the size of and trend in the electoral advantage of incumbency in Britain. Contrary to previous analyses, all based on measures now known to be biased, we demonstrate that the advantage is small but meaningful, varies substantially across the parties, and is not growing.

When a presidential election is this close, there exists the possibility that the popular vote winner and the electoral vote winner will differ, which has happened four times before (1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000), but continues to be controversial. More ominously, there is also a small, but real chance of an electoral vote tie between the candidates, which would then place the selection of the president in the House of Representatives and the vice president in the Senate. Even though congressional selection is the constitutionally prescribed remedy and has historical precedents (1800, 1824), it seems unlikely that the Electoral College would long survive what would surely be a spirited public debate over who should choose the president. Thus, the 2012 election results may be too close to sustain the legitimacy of the presidential selection method.},

We also apply Bayesian statistics to empirical data from previous research investigating agile vs. structured development processes, the performance of programming languages, and random testing of object-oriented programs. In addition to being case studies demonstrating how Bayesian analysis can be applied in practice, they provide insights beyond the results in the original publications (which used frequentist statistics), thus showing the practical value brought by Bayesian statistics.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the support vector regression (SVR) as a robust alternative to partial least squares (PLS) in multivariate calibration using twelve public domain NIR spectroscopy datasets. It also proposes the use of the support vector regression â€“ recursive feature elimination (SVR-RFE) algorithm to select the most informative wavelengths for SVR models. Models based on full spectra were built using SVR and PLS, while wavelength selection methods were carried out using SVR-RFE, interval PLS (iPLS), backward interval PLS (biPLS), synergy interval PLS (siPLS), and successive projection algorithm PLS (SPA-PLS). The prediction performance of tested methods was measured by means of the root mean squared error (RMSE), index of agreement (d-index) and R2 on the test set. SVR-based models yielded the best results in 8 out of 12 datasets, 4 of them using full spectra and 4 relying on SVR-RFE selected wavelengths. Statistical comparison was carried out for the wavelength selection algorithms using Friedman test, which pointed the SVR-RFE as a competitive technique when compared to the other algorithms. This study revealed SVR as a robust alternative to PLS, especially when SVR-RFE is employed for wavelength selection.},

It improves over the other robust regression methods such as least trimmed squares (LTS) in the sense that it can achieve maximum breakdown value and full asymptotic efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, its computational complexity is no more than that of LTS. We also propose a sparse estimator, called sparse regression with outlier shrinkage (SROS), for robust variable selection and estimation. It is proven that SROS can not only give consistent selection but also estimate the nonzero coefficients with full asymptotic efficiency under the normal model. In addition, we introduce a concept of nearly regression equivariant estimator for understanding the breakdown properties of sparse estimators, and prove that SROS achieves the maximum breakdown value of nearly regression equivariant estimators.

This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combined F-test 5x2 cross-validation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014. We conducted an extensive set of empirical analyses to examine the effect of the number of events per variable (EPV) on the relative performance of three different methods for assessing the predictive accuracy of a logistic regression model: apparent performance in the analysis sample, split-sample validation, and optimism correction using bootstrap methods. Using a single dataset of patients hospitalized with heart failure, we compared the estimates of discriminatory performance from these methods to those for a very large independent validation sample arising from the same population. As anticipated, the apparent performance was optimistically biased, with the degree of optimism diminishing as the number of events per variable increased. Differences between the bootstrap-corrected approach and the use of an independent validation sample were minimal once the number of events per variable was at least 20. Split-sample assessment resulted in too pessimistic and highly uncertain estimates of model performance. Apparent performance estimates had lower mean squared error compared to split-sample estimates, but the lowest mean squared error was obtained by bootstrap-corrected optimism estimates. For bias, variance, and mean squared error of the performance estimates, the penalty incurred by using split-sample validation was equivalent to reducing the sample size by a proportion equivalent to the proportion of the sample that was withheld for model validation. In conclusion, split-sample validation is inefficient and apparent performance is too optimistic for internal validation of regression-based prediction models. Modern validation methods, such as bootstrap-based optimism correction, are preferable. While these findings may be unsurprising to many statisticians, the results of the current study reinforce what should be considered good statistical practice in the development and validation of clinical prediction models.},

@article{Dormann2013,
abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

abstract = {Regression techniques are versatile in their application to medical research because they can measure associations, predict outcomes, and control for confounding variable effects. As one such technique, logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze the effect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome by quantifying each independent variable's unique contribution. Using components of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logistic regression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination of variables with the greatest probability of detecting the observed outcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regression include selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided by such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations, clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, with acknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should be accounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate number of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, with commonly recommended minimum "rules of thumb" ranging from 10 to 20 events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the three general types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, and stepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose. Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of these methods, one should formally quantify the model's internal validity (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting logistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is assessed using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized by a smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use of diagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacy of the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typically reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs).},

The ridge penalty is the sum of squared regression coefficients, giving rise to ridge regression. Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments, mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation to Bayesian regression. Finally, its behaviour and use are illustrated in simulation and on omics data. Subsequently, ridge regression is generalized to allow for a more general penalty. The ridge penalization framework is then translated to logistic regression and its properties are shown to carry over. To contrast ridge penalized estimation, the final chapter introduces its lasso counterpart.},

Voting power is important for studying political representation, fairness and strategy, and has been much discussed in political science. Although power indexes are often considered as mathematical definitions, they ultimately depend on statistical models of voting. Mathematical calculations of voting power usually have been performed under the model that votes are decided by coin flips. This simple model has interesting implications for weighted elections, two-stage elections (such as the U.S. Electoral College) and coalition structures. We discuss empirical failings of the coin-flip model of voting and consider, first, the implications for voting power and, second, ways in which votes could be modeled more realistically. Under the random voting model, the standard deviation of the average of n votes is proportional to 1/âˆšn, but under more general models, this variance can have the form cn-$\alpha$ or âˆša - b log n. Voting power calculations under more realistic models present research challenges in modeling and computation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The outcome of the 2016 presidential election is commonly attributed to socioeconomic and ethnic/racial issues, but health issues, including "deaths of despair," may also have contributed. OBJECTIVE To assess whether changes in age-adjusted death rates were independently associated with changes in presidential election voting in 2016 vs. 2008. DESIGN We used publicly available data in each of 3112 US counties to correlate changes in a county's presidential voting in 2016 compared with 2008 with recent changes in its age-adjusted death rate, after controlling for population and rural-urban status, median age, race/ethnicity, income, education, unemployment rate, and health insurance rate. DESIGN SETTING Cross-sectional analysis of county-specific data. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS All 3112 US counties. MAIN MEASURES The independent correlation of a county's change in age-adjusted death rate between 2000 and 2015 with its net percentage Republican gain or loss in the presidential election of 2016 vs. 2008. KEY RESULTS In 2016, President Trump increased the Republican presidential vote percentage in 83.8{\%} of counties compared with Senator McCain in 2008. Counties with an increased Republican vote percentage in 2016 vs. 2008 had a 15{\%} higher 2015 age-adjusted death rate than counties with an increased Democratic vote percentage. Since 2000, overall death rates declined by less than half as much, and death rates from drugs, alcohol, and suicide increased 2.5 times as much in counties with Republican gains compared with counties with Democratic gains. In multivariable analyses, Republican net presidential gain in 2016 vs. 2008 was independently correlated with slower reductions in a county's age-adjusted death rate. Although correlation cannot infer causality, modest reductions in death rates might theoretically have shifted Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to Secretary Clinton. CONCLUSIONS Less of a reduction in age-adjusted death rates was an independent correlate of an increased Republican percentage vote in 2016 vs. 2008. Death rates may be markers of dissatisfactions and fears that influenced the 2016 Presidential election outcomes.},

abstract = {The 2016 US Presidential Election was unprecedented, as traditional prediction methods failed to forecast the outcome. Using a demographic and political opinion survey of confirmed voters, we characterized President Trump's voters, particularly "non-Republicans," with two hypotheses: 1) Trump voters were economically downtrodden and 2) voters aligned with Trump's immigration and race rhetoric. We created two multilevel models with voter and state level variables and found partial support for the "economically downtrodden" hypothesis: a belief the economy became worse under President Obama was a strong predictor of a non-Republican vote for Trump. Actual income was not a significant predictor of vote. We also found support for the "race politics" hypothesis: supporting policies to curb immigration was a meaningful predictor non-Republicans would vote for Trump. While Republicans largely followed party lines, swing voters expressed discontent with the status of current economic and immigration/race issues and propelled Trump to the White House. Introduction In the 2016 presidential election, polls and predictive models failed to predict Donald Trump's victory. Since the election, many hypotheses have circulated as to why Trump received many unexpected votes. We set out to study the driving forces behind Trump's win by evaluating common characteristics among his voters. We evaluated two working hypotheses among political scientists using multi-level statistical modeling. The first hypothesis studied is that Trump voters tended to be economically downtrodden, voting for Trump as a candidate of change because of personal economic hardships. While this hypothesis finds support in popular media, there is evidence in opposition to it. 1 The second hypothesis is that Trump exploited fear of minorities and immigrants, therefore Trump voters' thoughts tend to parallel this rhetoric. Previous studies identified fear of losing majority status indeed impacts voting choice. 2 In addition, we assess how Trump's social rhetoric affected religiously-motivated voting, since his campaign emphasized retaliating against increasing secularization of the political landscape. Political scientists disagree on the causes of Trump's unexpected victory, but the hypotheses we evaluate relate to some of the most popular working theories attempting to explain the 2016 presidential election outcome.},

@article{Kurnaz2018,
abstract = {Fully robust versions of the elastic net estimator are introduced for linear and logistic regression. The algorithms used to compute the estimators are based on the idea of repeatedly applying the non-robust classical estimators to data subsets only. It is shown how outlier-free subsets can be identified efficiently, and how appropriate tuning parameters for the elastic net penalties can be selected. A final reweighting step improves the efficiency of the estimators. Simulation studies compare with non-robust and other competing robust estimators and reveal the superiority of the newly proposed methods. This is also supported by a reasonable computation time and by good performance in real data examples.},

abstract = {Learning from data is one of the basic ways humans perceive the world and acquire the knowledge. Support vector machine (SVM for short) has emerged as a good classification technique and achieved excellent generalization performance in a variety of applications. Training SVM on a dataset of huge size with millions of data is a challenging problem since it is computationally expensive and the memory requirement grows with the square of the number of training examples. This paper surveys SVM training algorithms and falls them into three groups. Moreover, recent advances such as finite Newton method and active learning algorithms are described.},
